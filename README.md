# React Frontend for Quotes Quarry

## üß† Problem

As a lover of books, I often encountered captivating passages that I wished to preserve beyond mere highlights that would be forgotten with time. Realizing the issue, led me to develop an app that solves this problem - welcome to Quotes Quarry!

## üîñ  Solution

Quotes Quarry allows users to seamlessly add noteworthy excerpts from books, complete with author and name of book. With ability to share some of these pieces on social media. The app is connected to an Express REST API and uses a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying. 

## üì° Technology Used

- **React:** Frontend framework for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Express:** Backend framework to handle API requests and interact with the database.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database to store user information and quotes securely.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for running the server-side application.
- **CSS:** Styling to enhance the user experience and make the app visually appealing.

## Improvements

- Implement end-to-end testing via Playwright
- Improve the accessibility of the app 
- Implement user authorization and login feature
