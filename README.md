# React Frontend for Quotes Quarry

## üß† Problem

As a lover of books, I often encountered captivating passages that I wished to preserve beyond mere highlights that would be forgotten with time. Realizing the issue, led me to develop an app that solves this problem - welcome to Quotes Quarry!

## üîñ  Solution

Quotes Quarry allows users to seamlessly add noteworthy excerpts from books, complete with author and name of book. Plus, you can easily share these literary gems on your social media accounts as well :)

## üí™üèΩ Process
The app is connected to a server in the backend built using Express REST API. The smooth connection between the client (user) and the backend (server) ensures that the right information is fetched and delivered efficiently. The server connects to a database (PostgreSQL). It's where all the information about the quotes is stored. Just as a library helps you find a book by its title or author, the database allows the app to quickly find and retrieve the quotes the user is looking for.


## üì° Technology Used

- **React:** Frontend framework for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Express:** Backend framework to handle API requests and interact with the database.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database to store user information and quotes securely.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for running the server-side application.
- **CSS:** Styling to enhance the user experience and make the app visually appealing.

## Improvements

- Implement end-to-end testing via Playwright
- Improve the accessibility of the app 
- Implement user authorization and login feature so users can access their own dedicated quotes page
